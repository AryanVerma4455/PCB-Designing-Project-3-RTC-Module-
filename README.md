# PCB-Designing-Project-3-RTC-Module-
In this project, an IR (Infrared) sensor is designed from scratch using KiCad, starting from schematic capture to PCB layout. The design includes a two-layer PCB and follows basic PCB designing principles. All components are properly referenced, and standard PCB keywords are used.
